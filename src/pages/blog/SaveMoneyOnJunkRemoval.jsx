      {
        title: 'Get a Real Quote — Not a “Starting At” Price',
        text: 'Many junk removal companies will advertise $75 or $100, but that’s just to show up. The final cost? Way higher. Ask for a real quote based on what you’re hauling. At Junk Buddies, we give you a total price upfront — no games.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Combine Items for Fewer Trips',
        text: 'If you’re doing a garage, shed, or apartment cleanout, try to bundle everything into one job. Multiple trips = multiple fees with most companies. One truckload saves time and money.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Compare Load Size vs. Itemized Pricing',
        text: 'Some jobs are cheaper by the truckload. Others, by the item. Use our hybrid pricing system to choose whichever saves you more. You’ll see the price difference instantly before booking.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Be Honest About What You’re Hauling',
        text: 'Don’t downplay your items to get a lower estimate. If the crew shows up and you’ve got way more than you said, most companies will bump the price. Be straight — it actually saves money.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Remove Hazardous or Special Items Yourself',
        text: 'Paints, chemicals, or heavy construction debris? These items usually cost extra. If you’re able, remove them yourself and only pay for what we can haul.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Check for Bulk Trash Days',
        text: 'Some neighborhoods offer bulk trash pickups once a month. If your items qualify, you might not even need junk removal — or at least, it’ll reduce your load.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Donate What You Can First',
        text: 'Furniture, electronics, and clothes in good condition can often be donated. That’s less stuff you pay to remove — and you’re helping others too.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Ask If We’re in Your Area That Day',
        text: 'If we’re already hauling nearby, we’ll often offer a “route discount.” Same crew, same truck, lower price.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Book Ahead (When Possible)',
        text: 'Same-day service is great — and we offer it — but if you can schedule ahead, you may unlock better availability or discounts for off-peak times.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Don’t Wait Until It’s an Emergency',
        text: 'When junk piles up and you’re rushing, it’s easy to overspend. Planning ahead helps you avoid emergency fees and gives you time to compare options.'
      }
